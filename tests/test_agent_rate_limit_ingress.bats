# Issue #1226 (Gap 2) — the agent rate-limit guard must not FAIL OPEN on an
# ADR-0007 collapsed repo.
#
# A collapsed repo serves each agent role from ONE job of agent-ingress.yml; the
# per-role workflow no longer exists. Before this fix, both
# arl_count_concurrent_runs (scripts/lib/agent-rate-limit.sh) and argate_fetch_runs
# (scripts/agent-rate-limit-gate.sh) enumerated runs BY WORKFLOW, got nothing, and
# read concurrency as 0 — so the guard never throttled that repo. Worse, a
# permanent "no such workflow" was indistinguishable from a transient API blip.
#
# Now:
#   - a permanent missing workflow falls back to agent-ingress.yml runs attributed
#     by role-bearing JOB (consistent with .github-private run-attribution.sh);
#   - with neither a workflow nor an ingress the count is UNRESOLVED (never 0),
#     and the admission gate fails closed (defer);
#   - a transient failure still degrades permissively with its existing warning.
#
# `gh` is a fixture-driven fake; no network is touched.
