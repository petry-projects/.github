# force_review decision for the pr-review-mention reusable workflow (#1281).
#
# Pure and side-effect-free, so it can be unit-tested with bats (see
# test/workflows/pr-review-mention/force-review.bats). The reusable sources this
# file from its own commit and acts on the verdict in "Trigger review agent".
#
# pr-review.yml in .github-private sets FORCE_REVIEW (skip the advisory-bot and
# comment-disposition waiting gates; the review itself still runs in full) only
# when the dispatch carries client_payload.force_review == true. The rule:
#   - a trusted human's @donpetry-bot comment (OWNER / MEMBER / COLLABORATOR,
#     not donpetry-bot, no automation marker) is the break-glass → force;
#   - the review_requested path never forces;
#   - a comment carrying an automation marker never forces. Agents post as the
#     owner account, so the association alone cannot tell them from a person.
# Known, accepted limit: an agent posting as the owner WITHOUT a marker is
# indistinguishable from the maintainer and is forced too.

# Body substrings that identify an agent-posted comment.
