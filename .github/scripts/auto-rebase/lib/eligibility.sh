# Eligibility predicate for the auto-rebase reusable workflow.
#
# Pure and side-effect-free so it can be unit-tested with bats (see
# test/workflows/auto-rebase/eligibility.bats). The reusable workflow sources
# this file and uses the predicate to decide which behind PRs to update-branch.
#
# Contract: see .github/scripts/auto-rebase/README.md

# auto_rebase_pr_eligible MODE
#   Decides whether a behind PR should be updated. Returns 0 (eligible) or
#   2 (unknown mode).
#
#   Modes (the tunable `eligibility` workflow input):
#     all   every behind PR, including drafts.
#
#   Kept as a mode dispatch so future modes (e.g. a "front-of-queue N") can be
#   added here and selected via the `eligibility` input without changing the
#   workflow file.
