# Ready-check decision logic for the pr-auto-review reusable workflow.
#
# These are pure, side-effect-free functions so they can be unit-tested with
# bats (see test/workflows/pr-auto-review/ready-check.bats). The reusable
# workflow sources this file and uses the predicate to decide whether a PR's
# CI checks satisfy the passing-gate before dispatching the review agent.
#
# Contract: see .github/scripts/pr-auto-review/README.md
# Pins issue #680.

# pr_auto_review_required_contexts
#   Reads a branch-rules JSON array on stdin (the response of
#   `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/rules/branches/{branch}`) and emits a compact
#   JSON array of the required status-check context names. Emits `[]` when
#   there is no required_status_checks rule or the input is not an array
#   (e.g. a `{"message": "Not Found"}` error body).
pr_auto_review_required_contexts() {
  jq -c '
    if type == "array" then
      [ .[]
        | select(.type == "required_status_checks")
        | .parameters?.required_status_checks?[]?
        | .context
        | select(type == "string")
      ]
    else
      []

  '
}

# pr_auto_review_checks_ready REQUIRED_JSON SELF_NAME
#   Reads a checks JSON array on stdin (the response of
#   `gh pr checks --json bucket,name`; each element has .name and .bucket) and
#   decides whether the passing-gate is satisfied. Prints a one-line reason to
#   stdout. Returns 0 (ready) or 1 (not ready).
#
#   REQUIRED_JSON  JSON array of required status-check context names (may be []).
#   SELF_NAME      name of this workflow's own check run, excluded from the gate
#                  so an in-progress run does not block itself (may be "").
#
#   A check "matches" a required context when their names are equal, or when the
#   check name ends with " / <context>" (GitHub renders Actions checks as
#   "<workflow> / <job>" while rulesets store the bare job name), or the reverse.
#
#   Decision:
#     * REQUIRED_JSON non-empty → gate on the required contexts only. Not ready
#       if any required context has no matching check reported yet, or a matching
#       check is not in the "pass"/"skipping" bucket. Non-required contexts
#       (including cancelled advisory runs) are ignored entirely — issue #680.
#     * REQUIRED_JSON empty → fallback (option B): ignore the required set and
#       block only when a non-self check is failing or pending; "cancel",
#       "skipping" and "pass" are treated as non-blocking.

# pr_auto_review_blocking_thread_count
#   Reads a review-threads GraphQL response on stdin — the payload of
#   `reviewThreads(first:100){nodes{isResolved isOutdated}}` under
#   .data.repository.pullRequest — and prints the count of threads that should
#   BLOCK auto-dispatch: those that are unresolved AND not outdated.
#
#   Why isOutdated (issue #806): dev-lead's fix-review cycle often addresses an
#   advisory finding in a follow-up commit but never marks the thread resolved,
#   so the unresolved-threads gate stalls the PR even though the code is fixed.
#   GitHub sets reviewThread.isOutdated == true exactly when the diff position
#   the thread anchors to no longer exists at HEAD (the line changed / file
#   moved) — a heuristic that the diff anchor shifted, not a guarantee the
#   underlying concern was resolved. Treating an
#   unresolved-but-outdated thread as non-blocking clears the stall without the
#   producer having to resolve the thread first.
#
#   Fail-safe: only an explicit isOutdated == true makes a thread non-blocking;
#   a null / absent isOutdated on an unresolved thread still blocks, so a thread
#   whose staleness we cannot confirm is never silently dropped. A GraphQL error
#   body (no data / null nodes) yields 0.

#                      REVIEW_DECISION BLOCKING_THREAD_COUNT
#   Unified, pure readiness core for the pr-auto-review reusable workflow. Given
#   the PR facts gathered by the workflow's I/O glue, it evaluates all four
#   readiness criteria in gate order and PRINTS the decision class on stdout —
#   one of the classes Layer 2 decision-telemetry consumes:
#     skip-draft, skip-checks-pending, skip-changes-requested,
#     skip-unresolved-threads, dispatched
#   Returns 0 iff the PR is ready to dispatch (class == dispatched), else 1.
#
#   The workflow does the I/O (gh / GraphQL) and echoes the returned class to
#   `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`; this function makes no external calls.
#
#   STATE             PR state, e.g. OPEN / CLOSED / MERGED (gh: .state).

#   REVIEW_DECISION   effective review decision (gh: .reviewDecision; may be "").
#   BLOCKING_THREAD_COUNT  count of blocking threads — unresolved AND not outdated (may be "" → 0).
#
#   Criteria are evaluated in order, so an earlier skip wins over a later one
#   (e.g. a draft PR that also has CHANGES_REQUESTED reports skip-draft). The
