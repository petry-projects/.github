## Standards & Practices

All repositories in this org follow shared engineering standards defined in [`.github`](https://github.com/petry-projects/.github):

- **TDD** — tests are written before implementation; coverage gates enforced in CI
- **CodeQL** — static analysis on every PR
- **SonarCloud** — code quality and security scanning
- **Dependabot** — automated dependency updates with automerge for patch-level changes
- **Claude Code** — AI-assisted development via [agent standards](https://github.com/petry-projects/.github/blob/main/AGENTS.md)
