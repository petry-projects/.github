## Standards & Practices

All repositories in this org follow shared engineering standards defined in
[`.github`](https://github.com/petry-projects/.github):

- **[CI Standards](https://github.com/petry-projects/.github/blob/main/standards/ci-standards.md)** — Reusable workflow versioning via the `stable` channel;
  staged promotion through concentric rings; action pinning policy; permissions policy; workflow patterns
  by tech stack (Node.js, Go, Python, Electron).

- **[Advanced Security](https://github.com/petry-projects/.github/blob/main/standards/advanced-security.md)** — Code Security Configurations for the org
  fleet; push-protection live-fire canary test; custom secret scanning patterns; compliance audit checks.

- **[Push Protection](https://github.com/petry-projects/.github/blob/main/standards/push-protection.md)** — GitHub push protection (primary enforcement);
  local pre-commit prevention; CI secret scanning (secondary defense); incident response runbook.

- **[Gitignore Standard](https://github.com/petry-projects/.github/blob/main/standards/gitignore-standard.md)** — Two-layer model (L1 org-managed secrets
  baseline, L2 ecosystem extension); managed-block markers; negation discipline; compliance check.

- **[Agent Standards](https://github.com/petry-projects/.github/blob/main/standards/agent-standards.md)** — AgentShield deep security scan; required agent
  files and compliance exemptions; BMAD Method workflows; decision-making reusables.

- **[Dependabot Policy](https://github.com/petry-projects/.github/blob/main/standards/dependabot-policy.md)** — Stack-specific templates (npm, Go, Rust,
  Python, Terraform, Actions); auto-merge workflow; vulnerability audit CI check; CODEOWNERS approval
  timing.

- **[GitHub Settings](https://github.com/petry-projects/.github/blob/main/standards/github-settings.md)** — Repository rulesets (`pr-quality`,
  `code-quality`); auto-merge configuration; bypass actors; labels — standard set; org-level secrets.

- **[CODEOWNERS Standard](https://github.com/petry-projects/.github/blob/main/standards/codeowners-standard.md)** — Branch protection; team composition;
  required setup for new bots.

- **[Copilot Instructions Standard](https://github.com/petry-projects/.github/blob/main/standards/copilot-instructions-standard.md)** — Canonical
  instruction files (source of truth in `.github`); adding a new language; content quality rules.

- **[Feature Ideation Sources](https://github.com/petry-projects/.github/blob/main/standards/feature-ideation-sources.md)** — AI/ML vendor & lab primary
  sources; research & trends; developer tooling and platform changelogs; security & compliance feeds;
  newsletters, podcasts, and conferences.

- **[Initiatives Project](https://github.com/petry-projects/.github/blob/main/standards/initiatives-project.md)** — What belongs on the board; fields;
  theme → initiative mapping; views; how the auto-add works.

- **[Persona Standards](https://github.com/petry-projects/.github/blob/main/standards/persona-standards.md)** — Trigger matrix (the onboarding checklist);
  canary onboarding (the last step); trust, permissions, and safety.

- **[PR Limits](https://github.com/petry-projects/.github/blob/main/standards/pr-limits.md)** — Exempt actors; operator runbook; reconciliation with the
  Dependabot cap.

- **[Ruleset Remediation Runbook](https://github.com/petry-projects/.github/blob/main/standards/ruleset-remediation-runbook.md)** — Snapshot every ruleset
  for rollback insurance; bypass actor management; legacy ruleset migration; verify and rollback
  procedures.

## Reporting & Dashboards

Scheduled reports and dashboards post as issues or run summaries for org maintainers:

- **[Compliance audit & improvement](https://github.com/petry-projects/.github/blob/main/.github/workflows/compliance-audit-and-improvement.yml)**
  — Weekly org standards compliance audit + runtime health survey, with per-finding remediation issues.
- **[Daily org status](https://github.com/petry-projects/.github/blob/main/.github/workflows/daily-org-status.yml)**
  — Daily "Org Status" digest posted as an issue for maintainers.
- **[OpenSSF Scorecard](https://github.com/petry-projects/.github/blob/main/.github/workflows/org-scorecard.yml)**
  — Weekly security-posture review across public repos; findings tracked as issues.
