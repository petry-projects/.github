# Template-guard for `merge_group` on the org-standard required-check caller-stub
# templates under standards/workflows/ (#1157).
#
# A GitHub merge queue only merges a PR once its required status checks report on
# the queue's temporary `gh-readonly-queue/*` ref, which means every workflow that
# provides a required check MUST trigger on the `merge_group` event. Two org
# required-check stubs are owned here as thin caller stubs:
#
#   - agent-shield.yml       → required check `agent-shield / AgentShield`
#   - dependency-audit.yml   → required check `dependency-audit / Detect ecosystems`
#
# Consumer repos may NOT add `merge_group` themselves (the stubs forbid editing
# trigger events), so the trigger belongs in the template. This guard fails in CI
# the moment either required-check stub loses its `merge_group` trigger or renames
# the job that provides the required-status-check context.
