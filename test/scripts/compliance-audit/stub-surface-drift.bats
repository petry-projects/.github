# Tests for the caller-stub surface-drift guard in scripts/compliance-audit.sh
# (issue #607): stub_extract_blocks / stub_normalize_surface / stub_surface_drift.
#
# The centralized caller stubs (dev-lead + the RING reusables) are thin: their
# behavior lives in the reusable, so three surfaces are NOT repo-adjustable — the
# `on:` trigger set, the `permissions:` grants, and the (usually absent)
# `concurrency:` block. The field-allowlist pin checks never inspect those
# surfaces, so a stub that trims a trigger, widens/narrows a permission, or
# injects a per-stub concurrency group drifts silently. This guard catches it.
#
# These surfaces carry NO channel pin (the tier pin lives only on the
# jobs.<id>.uses / agent_ref lines), so a stub that differs from the canonical
# ONLY by its correct tier channel pin has identical surfaces and is never
# flagged. The tests below assert both directions.
#
# The script is sourced in an isolated subshell (its `main` is guarded, so
# sourcing only defines functions) and the real pure helpers are exercised.
