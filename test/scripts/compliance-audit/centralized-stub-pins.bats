# Tests for stub_pin_acceptable() in scripts/compliance-audit.sh — the pin-match
# used by check_centralized_workflow_stubs.
#
# During the #482 channel migration a stub is compliant if it pins the reusable
# at the canonical <name>/stable channel OR, transitionally, an accepted legacy
# @vN ref — so the audit neither flags nor reverts a stub mid-migration. A SHA
# pin, a commented-out line, or the wrong reusable must NOT satisfy the check.
#
# The script is sourced in an isolated subshell (its `main` is guarded, so
# sourcing only defines functions) and the real helper is exercised directly.
