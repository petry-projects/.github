# Tests for close_resolved_issues() and the read-only execution guard in
# scripts/compliance-audit.sh (issue #1036).
#
# The closer used to close ANY open issue carrying the `compliance-audit` label
# whose stripped title was absent from the current findings set — fail-open where
# the detection paths are fail-closed. That destroyed umbrella issues (title never
# matched) and every hand-filed issue anyone labelled `compliance-audit`, and it
# ran whenever the script executed. These tests pin the fixed contract:
#
#   AC1  — only close issues titled exactly `Compliance: <check>`.
#   AC1b — only close issues whose body carries the audit's generated-by marker.
#   AC1c — enumerate/close only issues carrying the machine label `compliance-finding`.
#   AC1d — an audit-labelled issue with a non-matching title and no marker survives.
#   AC2  — never close for a repo that was not scanned this run.
#   AC3  — never close anything when total findings across all repos is zero.
#   AC4  — default read-only: no mutation without --apply / COMPLIANCE_AUDIT_APPLY.
