# Regression guard for the secret-scan job's gitleaks config in
# .github/workflows/ci.yml.
#
# Pins issue #996: ci.yml's `Run gitleaks` step invoked `gitleaks detect` WITHOUT
# `--config .gitleaks.toml`, so gitleaks fell back to its default ruleset. The
# default `generic-api-key` rule fires false positives on certain file
# paths/names (see standards/push-protection.md — "Why a required config file?"),
# so a run whose commit range touched such a file failed while others passed —
# the content-dependent, intermittent failure behind the fleet failure-rate
# warning (11.1% = 1/9 runs). The canonical Layer-3 spec
# (standards/push-protection.md:241, 257-258) requires `--config .gitleaks.toml`
# and every adopting repo MUST ship that file at root. These tests assert both,
# so a future edit can't silently drop the config and reintroduce the flakiness.
