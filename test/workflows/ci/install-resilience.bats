# Regression guard for the flaky "Lint GitHub Actions" step in
# .github/workflows/ci.yml.
#
# Pins issue #894: ci.yml intermittently fails (~14% of runs) because the pinned
# rhysd/actionlint binary is fetched from GitHub Releases — which redirects to
# objects.githubusercontent.com — with a bare `curl` that aborts on the first
# transient network/5xx blip. This is the same failure mode fixed for
# pr-review-mention-tests.yml under #739. AGENTS.md requires CI to be reliable;
# the one unavoidable network fetch must therefore retry on transient errors.
# These tests assert every download in ci.yml carries bounded curl retries, so a
# future edit can't silently reintroduce a bare download.

# Emit the `run:` step block whose text contains the given marker substring.
# Steps in ci.yml start at a 6-space "- " (the `steps:` child indent); every
# deeper-indented line belongs to that step. Isolating a step lets each test
# assert resilience on the one fetch it cares about without matching flags that
# happen to appear in a neighbouring step.
