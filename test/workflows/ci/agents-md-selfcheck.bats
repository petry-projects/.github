# Regression guard for the informational AGENTS.md self-check wired into
# .github/workflows/ci.yml (issue #646, Phase 3 of epic #642).
#
# Phase 3 runs the standalone structural linter (scripts/agents-md-lint.sh)
# against THIS repo's own canonical AGENTS.md on every pull request, in
# INFORMATIONAL mode: it annotates each structural finding with a GitHub
# ::warning:: but must never fail the build (promotion to a failing/required
# check is deferred to Phase 4). These tests pin that contract so a future edit
# cannot silently (a) drop the self-check, (b) point it at the wrong file, or
# (c) flip it to failing mode and turn it into a de-facto blocking gate before
# Phase 4 sign-off.
