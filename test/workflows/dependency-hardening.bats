# Regression guard for SonarCloud GitHub Actions dependency-hardening findings
# (githubactions:S8541/S8543/S8544/S8545 for pip, S6505 for npx) — see issue #623.
#
# Every `pip install` in a workflow must resolve version- and hash-locked
# (`--require-hashes` + `--only-binary :all:`), and every `npx` invocation must
# refuse install-time lifecycle scripts (`--ignore-scripts`). These are the
# mitigations SonarCloud checks for; the guard fails loud if a new workflow
# reintroduces an unhardened install command.
