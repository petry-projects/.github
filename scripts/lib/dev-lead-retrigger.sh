# dev-lead-retrigger.sh — shared helpers for re-engaging the dev-lead agent on a
# compliance issue by cycling its trigger label.
#
# Sourced by:
#   scripts/compliance-audit.sh      — weekly audit; re-triggers findings that
#                                      persist across runs (issue still open).
#   scripts/compliance-retrigger.sh  — daily sweep; re-triggers stale issues.
#
# Why a shared lib?
#   Both entry points need the same two primitives, and both depend on how
#   dev-lead names its branches (dev-lead/issue-<number>-<timestamp>, see
#   scripts/dev-lead-fix-issue.sh in the agent repo). Keeping that convention in
#   one place stops the two callers from drifting apart.
#
# These functions are pure helpers: they take all inputs as arguments and call
# `gh api` directly, so they do not depend on the sourcing script's own wrappers
# or globals.

# dl_dev_lead_active <org> <repo> <issue>
# Returns 0 (true) if dev-lead is ALREADY working this issue — either an open PR
# exists on a dev-lead/issue-<number>-* branch, or the issue carries the
# `in-progress` label. In that case the caller must NOT cycle the trigger label,
# to avoid interrupting or duplicating active work.

  # scope issue), treat the issue as active so we do not cycle the label and
