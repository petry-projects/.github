# The #482 `.github`-hosted reusables (and dev-lead) are released through the
# concentric-ring channels of epic #495: next → ring0 → ring1 → stable. Both
# the compliance audit (`check_centralized_workflow_stubs` in
# compliance-audit.sh) and the deploy sweep (`is_already_compliant` in
# deploy-standard-workflows.sh) must agree on
#   (a) which repo sits in which ring tier, and
#   (b) which `@<channel>` refs are acceptable for a stub in that repo,
# otherwise "drift" (deploy) and "non-compliant" (audit) diverge — the exact
# three-way inconsistency #482 exists to close. This file is sourced by both so
# they can never drift again.
#
# Keep the topology in sync with petry-projects/.github-private's
# scripts/cut-release.sh channels and docs/release/.
