# shellcheck shell=bash
# scripts/lib/persona-mention.sh — Persona @-mention routing core
#
# Reusable Bash library implementing the routing decisions behind §4.1 of
#
#   standards/persona-standards.md
#
# A persona is addressed by an org TEAM handle — `@petry-projects/<role>` — and
# the manifest at `personas/<role>/persona.yml` in petry-projects/.github-private
# is the index-of-record for whether that mention should do anything. There is no
# derived index: `validate-personas.py` enforces `address.handle`'s slug == `id`
# == the persona's directory name, so a handle resolves to a manifest path by
# convention. A 404 simply means "not a persona" — which is also how a real,
# non-persona team (`@petry-projects/org-leads`) falls through harmlessly.
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Caller contract
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This library is `set -euo pipefail`-safe and designed to be sourced by a parent
# script (`# shellcheck source=scripts/lib/persona-mention.sh`). It does NOT call
# `set` itself and runs nothing at source time.
#
# Reads (all optional, with defaults):
#   - $PERSONA_ORG        — org that owns the persona teams (default: petry-projects)
#   - $PERSONA_REPO       — repo holding personas/<id>/persona.yml
#                           (default: petry-projects/.github-private)
#   - $PERSONA_REF        — ref to read manifests at (default: main)
#   - $PERSONA_BOT_LOGINS — space/comma-separated logins whose comments never
#                           trigger a persona (default: donpetry-bot github-actions[bot])
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Recursion is the hazard this library exists to bound
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Comments posted with a PAT re-trigger workflows (unlike GITHUB_TOKEN).
# .github-private#860 burned 1,481 identical acks in 4.5h from a SINGLE
# self-loop, and #538 traced it to an agent emitting a literal '@<handle>' in
# its own comment. With N mutually addressable personas the cycles stop being
# self-loops and become combinatorial: qa-lead answering a thread that mentions
# dev-lead is enough.
#
# So every routing decision here excludes on TWO independent axes, per §4.1:
#   1. the bot actor  — a comment authored by an agent identity never routes, and
#   2. the marker     — a comment carrying '<!-- persona:' never routes,
# and callers MUST NOT emit a literal '@<org>/<slug>' in any agent-authored
# comment. Belt and suspenders: either axis alone closes the common loop, and
# both together close the case where an agent posts under a human's PAT.

# pm_extract_slugs <body> — emit each DISTINCT persona slug addressed in body.
#
# Matches '@<org>/<slug>' where slug is kebab-case, mirroring the schema's
# address.handle pattern. Order is preserved (first mention wins) and duplicates
# collapse, so '@petry-projects/qa-lead ... @petry-projects/qa-lead' dispatches
# once rather than twice.
#
# A match here is NOT a decision to run: the slug still has to resolve to a
# manifest that enables the mention surface. Real teams (org-leads) match the
# shape and are dropped later by a 404.
# pm_strip_unaddressable <body> — drop regions where a handle must not count.
#
# Three regions, two reasons:
#
#   fenced code (``` / ~~~)  — GitHub renders NO mention here and notifies nobody.
#   inline code (`...`)      — likewise. Firing on these means the router is more
#                              trigger-happy than GitHub's own semantics: pasting
#                              a usage example, or documenting the handle, would
#                              summon the persona.
#   blockquotes (^>)         — a DELIBERATE divergence. GitHub *does* render and
#                              notify on a quoted mention, but GitHub's one-click
#                              "Quote reply" copies a whole prior comment prefixed
#                              with '>', and re-running an agent over quoted text
#                              is almost never what the quoter meant. Neither
#                              recursion axis catches it (a human quoting a human
#                              is not a bot and carries no marker). To address a
#                              persona, mention it outside the quote.

# <id>:hands-off. The event-driven surfaces already honour all of them (the
# .github-private pull_request advisory gate; hold-gate.sh). The mention router
# honoured only the opt-out label, so a mention on a HELD item still dispatched

# router honour the persona's OWN declared markers, read from the contract, so no
# marker is ever a literal in the routing logic (#1133 AC #2).

# pm_stop_markers <interaction-yaml> — emit each declared stop marker, one per

# on stdin so it stays pure and testable — fetching is the caller's job, exactly

# pm_first_stop_marker <interaction-yaml> — read the item's labels from stdin
# (one per line) and emit the first declared stop_marker present among them, or
# nothing. Empty output (with exit 0) means "not held — routing may proceed"; a
# non-empty line is the brake the router should name in its skip log.
#
# Matching is whole-line, newline-delimited on both sides — mirroring
# hold-gate.sh's hold_gate_first_match — so a label or marker containing spaces
# is compared as a whole (GitHub label names may contain spaces) and
# `needs-human-review` never matches `needs-human-review-later`. Declaration
# order in the contract decides which marker is reported when several are
# present.
#
# The markers are captured before the scan (not streamed via a process
# substitution) so an unparseable contract — pm_stop_markers exits non-zero —
# PROPAGATES as return 2 rather than being swallowed into "no markers". A 200
# with a corrupt body must never be read as "not held" any more than a 5xx must;
# the router runs `set -euo pipefail`, so a 2 here fails the job (fail-closed).
