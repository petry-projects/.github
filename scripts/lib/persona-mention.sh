# shellcheck shell=bash
# scripts/lib/persona-mention.sh — Persona @-mention routing core
#
# Reusable Bash library implementing the routing decisions behind §4.1 of
#
#   standards/persona-standards.md
#
# A persona is addressed by an org TEAM handle — `@petry-projects/<role>` — and
# the manifest at `personas/<role>/persona.yml` in petry-projects/.github-private
# is the index-of-record for whether that mention should do anything. There is no
# derived index: `validate-personas.py` enforces `address.handle`'s slug == `id`
# == the persona's directory name, so a handle resolves to a manifest path by
# convention. A 404 simply means "not a persona" — which is also how a real,
# non-persona team (`@petry-projects/org-leads`) falls through harmlessly.
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Caller contract
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This library is `set -euo pipefail`-safe and designed to be sourced by a parent
# script (`# shellcheck source=scripts/lib/persona-mention.sh`). It does NOT call
# `set` itself and runs nothing at source time.
#
# Reads (all optional, with defaults):
#   - $PERSONA_ORG        — org that owns the persona teams (default: petry-projects)
#   - $PERSONA_REPO       — repo holding personas/<id>/persona.yml
#                           (default: petry-projects/.github-private)
#   - $PERSONA_REF        — ref to read manifests at (default: main)
#   - $PERSONA_BOT_LOGINS — space/comma-separated logins whose comments never
#                           trigger a persona (default: donpetry-bot github-actions[bot])
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Recursion is the hazard this library exists to bound
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Comments posted with a PAT re-trigger workflows (unlike GITHUB_TOKEN).
# .github-private#860 burned 1,481 identical acks in 4.5h from a SINGLE
# self-loop, and #538 traced it to an agent emitting a literal '@<handle>' in
# its own comment. With N mutually addressable personas the cycles stop being
# self-loops and become combinatorial: qa-lead answering a thread that mentions
# dev-lead is enough.
#
# So every routing decision here excludes on TWO independent axes, per §4.1:
#   1. the bot actor  — a comment authored by an agent identity never routes, and
#   2. the marker     — a comment carrying '<!-- persona:' never routes,
# and callers MUST NOT emit a literal '@<org>/<slug>' in any agent-authored
# comment. Belt and suspenders: either axis alone closes the common loop, and
# both together close the case where an agent posts under a human's PAT.

# Uses python+yaml rather than yq: the fleet's runners are guaranteed python3 +
# PyYAML (validate-personas.py depends on both) but not yq.

  # then distinguish "manifest says no" from "manifest never parsed" — a silent
  # mis-route. The library is sourced by `set -euo pipefail` parents but must not
  # call `set` itself (caller contract), so pipefail is not ours to switch on.
