# shellcheck shell=bash
# scripts/lib/persona-mention.sh — Persona @-mention routing core
#
# Reusable Bash library implementing the routing decisions behind §4.1 of
#
#   standards/persona-standards.md
#
# A persona is addressed by an org TEAM handle — `@petry-projects/<role>` — and
# the manifest at `personas/<role>/persona.yml` in petry-projects/.github-private
# is the index-of-record for whether that mention should do anything. There is no
# derived index: `validate-personas.py` enforces `address.handle`'s slug == `id`
# == the persona's directory name, so a handle resolves to a manifest path by
# convention. A 404 simply means "not a persona" — which is also how a real,
# non-persona team (`@petry-projects/org-leads`) falls through harmlessly.
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Caller contract
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This library is `set -euo pipefail`-safe and designed to be sourced by a parent
# script (`# shellcheck source=scripts/lib/persona-mention.sh`). It does NOT call
# `set` itself and runs nothing at source time.
#
# Reads (all optional, with defaults):
#   - $PERSONA_ORG        — org that owns the persona teams (default: petry-projects)
#   - $PERSONA_REPO       — repo holding personas/<id>/persona.yml
#                           (default: petry-projects/.github-private)
#   - $PERSONA_REF        — ref to read manifests at (default: main)
#   - $PERSONA_BOT_LOGINS — space/comma-separated logins whose comments never
#                           trigger a persona (default: donpetry-bot github-actions[bot])
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Recursion is the hazard this library exists to bound
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Comments posted with a PAT re-trigger workflows (unlike GITHUB_TOKEN).
# .github-private#860 burned 1,481 identical acks in 4.5h from a SINGLE
# self-loop, and #538 traced it to an agent emitting a literal '@<handle>' in
# its own comment. With N mutually addressable personas the cycles stop being
# self-loops and become combinatorial: qa-lead answering a thread that mentions
# dev-lead is enough.
#
# So every routing decision here excludes on TWO independent axes, per §4.1:
#   1. the bot actor  — a comment authored by an agent identity never routes, and
#   2. the marker     — a comment carrying '<!-- persona:' never routes,
# and callers MUST NOT emit a literal '@<org>/<slug>' in any agent-authored
# comment. Belt and suspenders: either axis alone closes the common loop, and
# both together close the case where an agent posts under a human's PAT.

# collapse, so '@petry-projects/qa-lead ... @petry-projects/qa-lead' dispatches
# once rather than twice.
#
# A match here is NOT a decision to run: the slug still has to resolve to a
# manifest that enables the mention surface. Real teams (org-leads) match the
# shape and are dropped later by a 404.
# pm_strip_unaddressable <body> — drop regions where a handle must not count.
#
# Three regions, two reasons:
#
#   fenced code (``` / ~~~)  — GitHub renders NO mention here and notifies nobody.
#   inline code (`...`)      — likewise. Firing on these means the router is more
#                              trigger-happy than GitHub's own semantics: pasting
#                              a usage example, or documenting the handle, would
#                              summon the persona.
#   blockquotes (^>)         — a DELIBERATE divergence. GitHub *does* render and
#                              notify on a quoted mention, but GitHub's one-click
#                              "Quote reply" copies a whole prior comment prefixed
#                              with '>', and re-running an agent over quoted text
#                              is almost never what the quoter meant. Neither
#                              recursion axis catches it (a human quoting a human
#                              is not a bot and carries no marker). To address a

# pm_pr_should_route <author> <actor> <author_association> <body> — 0 if a
# pull_request event is worth acting on. The CHEAP pre-filter for the PR path,
# mirrored from pm_should_route but WITHOUT the @-mention requirement: a PR
# persona is derived from manifests, never addressed in the body. Both recursion
# axes and the conservative §4 default floor still apply, so this path is no
# laxer than the mention path's pre-filter (AC #4).
#
# Recursion axis 1 checks BOTH identities, not just the PR author.
# `pull_request.user.login` is the PR's original author and never changes once
# the PR is opened; the ACTOR of a `synchronize`/`reopened` event is whoever
# pushed the update or reopened the PR. An agent pushing a commit to a human's
# PR keeps a human author but is a bot actor — checking the author alone lets
# that agent update re-trigger the router and dispatch personas again (the
# codeant/tier-3 finding). Excluding a bot on EITHER identity closes it.

# pm_pr_route_verdict <manifest-yaml> <interaction-yaml> <author_association> —
# read the item's labels from stdin (one per line) and decide the verdict for
# ONE persona on the pull_request surface. The caller has already established
# that the persona DECLARES the surface enabled and is not opted out (both cheap,
# label-free / manifest-only checks); this composes the remaining, label-and-
# contract-dependent gauntlet in the SAME precedence the mention path uses:
#
#   stop marker  -> "skip stop-marker <marker>"   (the human hold, AC #2)
#   write gate   -> "skip not-armed <gate>"       (unarmed write, AC #4)
#   trust floor  -> "skip below-floor"            (author below the persona floor)
#   otherwise    -> "dispatch <mode>"
#

#   - the interaction contract is unreadable/malformed — return 2. The contract
#     is passed already-fetched; a non-200/404 fetch is the caller's to fail on
#     (pm_fetch_disposition), but a 200 with a corrupt body surfaces here as a
#     non-zero from pm_first_stop_marker and must PROPAGATE, never be read as
#     "not held".
#   - a write surface declares no gate_label — return 3. That is a schema
#     violation validate-personas.py should have caught; dispatching it would be
