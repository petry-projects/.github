# scripts/lib/gitignore-baseline.sh — shared, idempotent upsert of the org secrets
# baseline (the L1 block) into a repo's .gitignore.
#
# The canonical L1 block lives in this repo's root /.gitignore, wrapped in the
# BEGIN/END markers defined by the .gitignore standard (standards/gitignore-standard.md,
# STORY1 / #797). This lib is the single mechanism that PLACES or REFRESHES that
# block in a target .gitignore. It is pure text (no gh, no network) so it can be
# unit-tested and reused by every distribution path:
#
#   • scripts/bootstrap-new-repo.sh          — seed the baseline into a new repo
#   • scripts/sync-gitignore-baseline.sh     — append-or-replace it fleet-wide
#   • STORY4 remediation                     — fix a drifted repo in place
#
# Contract (matches standards/gitignore-standard.md's two-layer model):
#   L1 — the marker-wrapped block; org-managed, byte-for-byte identical, on TOP.
#   L2 — everything BELOW the END marker; per-repo, freely edited, NEVER touched.
#
#   Nothing goes ABOVE the BEGIN marker; if a stale file somehow has content there
#   it is preserved (the standard forbids it, but the lib does not silently drop
#   bytes it didn't author).
#
# shellcheck shell=bash

# _gib_neutralize_l2 <block>
# Read candidate L2 content on stdin; print it with every line that would fight
# the L1 block removed, then append a *minimal* re-allow tail. Two passes:
#
# Pass 1 (pure awk) drops L2 lines that duplicate the block:
#   • Pattern lines: a line is dropped when — after CRLF and trailing-whitespace
#     trimming — it exactly matches a *pattern* line of <block>. This strips a
#     bare re-hider the target kept in L2 (e.g. `*.pem` with no `!public.pem`,
#     identical to the block's own broad pattern) and folds away an old
#     *unmarkered* baseline pasted into L2 (all its pattern lines now live in the
#     block, so upsert stops shipping a second copy).
#   • Comment lines (#817 Part B): a comment line is dropped only when it exactly
#     matches a *comment* line of the block AND is not a bare `#` separator. This
#     removes the orphaned section comments a migrated unmarkered baseline leaves
#     behind, while never clobbering a repo's own comments — bare `#` dividers
#     (which the block also uses) are always preserved.
# Genuine per-repo ecosystem/OS entries are untouched. Runs of blank lines left
# behind by removed lines are squeezed (leading and consecutive blanks dropped)
# so migration output stays tidy.
#
# Pass 2 (#817 Part A) appends a *conditional* re-allow tail. A glob-variant L2
# pattern that is NOT an exact match for any block line (e.g. `**/*.pem` or
# `.env*`) can still re-hide a baseline-negated path (`!public.pem`, `!.env.example`).
# Rather than re-emit ALL ~32 baseline negations unconditionally (noise on every
# repo), we compose `block + neutralized-L2` and ask git — the authority on
# gitignore semantics — which negated paths are STILL ignored. Only those
# negations are re-emitted, in block order, so they win over the surviving L2
# pattern. A clean L2 that re-hides nothing gets NO tail. See _gib_negation_tail.
#
# Idempotent: exact-match lines are gone after pass 1; any re-emitted tail lines
# are themselves block negation patterns, so a second pass strips them before
# pass 2 recomputes them identically. An already-current file stays byte-for-byte
# identical on re-run — and, with the conditional tail, on the FIRST application.

#                      output of gib_extract_baseline_block).
#   • [existing_file]— the target repo's current .gitignore. Absent/empty/missing
#                      is treated as a brand-new file.
#
# Behaviour (idempotent):
#   • existing has the markers  → REPLACE the block in place; content above BEGIN
#                                 is preserved verbatim and the L2 below END is
#                                 neutralized (see below).
#   • existing lacks the markers → INSERT the block on top; the existing file
#                                 becomes L2 below the END marker, neutralized.
#   • existing empty/absent      → output is exactly the block.
#
# L2 neutralization (#809): every L2 line that duplicates a block *pattern* line is
# dropped, so a re-hiding pattern the target kept in L2 (e.g. a bare `*.pem` with no
# `!public.pem`) can't override the block's negations, and an old unmarkered
# baseline pasted into L2 folds into the single block instead of duplicating.
# Genuine per-repo L2 (ecosystem/OS entries) is preserved. See _gib_neutralize_l2.
