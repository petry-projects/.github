# scripts/lib/standards-release.sh — pure decision core for the standards
# release channel (issue #1091).
#
# `standards/` is consumed by other repos as a versioned artifact. This library
# defines the tag vocabulary and the version math for publishing it, mirroring
# the org's reusable-workflow versioning model (standards/ci-standards.md →
# "Reusable workflow versioning — the stable channel"; scripts/lib/canary-
# rollout.sh's max_semver / channel_tag / _is_release_tag_suffix). Because
# standards are per-repo (one artifact, one channel), the shape is simpler than
# the per-agent concentric rings — there is one immutable release form and one
# moving channel, no ring membership.
#
# Immutable release form : standards/vX.Y.Z   (never moved, never deleted)
# Moving channel         : standards/v<major>-stable  (e.g. standards/v1-stable)
#
# This file is side-effect-free and `source`-able: it defines pure functions
# only (no gh/git/network) so the cut decision can be unit-tested
# deterministically. The orchestrator scripts/cut-standards-release.sh sources
# this and feeds it facts gathered from git/gh (AGENTS.md → "Decision Logic
# Lives in a Pure, Tested Script").
