# migrate-claude-label.sh — One-time org-wide migration of the legacy `claude`
# issue-trigger label to the canonical `dev-lead` label.
#
# Background:
#   The dev-lead agent historically accepted BOTH `dev-lead` and `claude` labels
#   (claude being backward-compat from the retired claude.yml workflow). We are
#   removing the `claude` label entirely. dev-lead now triggers on `dev-lead`
#   only, and the compliance audit creates/cycles the `dev-lead` label.
#
# What this does, per non-archived org repo that has a `claude` label:
#   1. Ensure the `dev-lead` label exists (created idempotently).
#   2. For every OPEN issue still labelled `claude`, add the `dev-lead` label so
#      the issue stays actionable. (Adding the label re-fires issues:labeled, so
#      dev-lead will pick the issue up — this is intended: a `claude`-labelled
#      open issue was already pending pickup.)
#   3. If DELETE_OLD_LABEL=true, delete the `claude` label object from the repo,
#      which strips it from every issue/PR (open and closed).
#
# Idempotent: re-running skips issues that already carry `dev-lead` (no duplicate
# trigger) and is a no-op once the `claude` label has been deleted.
#
# Environment:
#   GH_TOKEN          — token with issues:write + repo admin (label delete) across
#                       the org (e.g. ORG_SCORECARD_TOKEN). Required.
#   ORG               — GitHub org (default: petry-projects)
#   OLD_LABEL         — legacy label to retire (default: claude)
#   NEW_LABEL         — canonical replacement label (default: dev-lead)
#   NEW_LABEL_COLOR   — hex color for the new label (default: 8B5CF6)
#   NEW_LABEL_DESC    — description for the new label (default: For dev-lead agent pickup)
#   DELETE_OLD_LABEL  — "true" to delete the old label object (default: true)
#   DRY_RUN           — "true" to log without mutating (default: true — safe)
#   TARGET_REPO       — limit to one repo (name or owner/name); blank = all repos
