# compliance-retrigger.sh — Re-trigger stale compliance-audit issues.
#
# Run hourly (see .github/workflows/compliance-retrigger.yml). The per-run
# one-engagement-per-repo throttle means each repo gets at most one issue
# re-triggered per run (≈ one per hour on the scheduled cadence), draining
# each repo's backlog steadily without bursts.
#
# What it does:
#   Finds all open compliance-audit issues that are ≥ STALE_DAYS old and
#   have no associated open PR on a dev-lead branch.  Cycles the "dev-lead"
#   label (remove + re-add) to re-fire the issues:labeled event and give
#   dev-lead a fresh chance to create a fix PR.
#
#      Throttling: at most ONE issue per repo is engaged per run (shared across
#      the primary and legacy-label sweeps), and a repo already active (open PR
#      or in-progress issue) is skipped.  Issues are processed oldest-first, so
#      the most-stuck finding in each repo is the one re-engaged; the hourly
#      cadence drains the rest of each repo's backlog one at a time.  This keeps
#      concurrent dev-lead runs in any single repo to one, avoiding the rebase
#      storms and token exhaustion a fleet-wide burst would cause.
#
# Why re-trigger instead of relying on the original event?
#   GitHub only fires issues:labeled once per label application.  If dev-lead
#   had a transient failure at that moment (template error, git-identity bug,
#   rate-limit, disabled workflow), the event is lost forever unless the label
#   is re-applied.  This script recovers those lost events automatically.
#
# Environment:
#   GH_TOKEN      — must have issues:write and contents:read across the org
#   ORG           — GitHub org name (default: petry-projects)
#   STALE_DAYS    — issues older than this are considered stale (default: 2)
#   DRY_RUN       — set to "true" to log actions without executing them
#   AUDIT_LABEL   — label used to tag compliance findings (default: compliance-audit)
#   TRIGGER_LABEL — label used to trigger dev-lead (default: claude)

# Repos that already have an in-flight dev-lead engagement THIS run — either an

# per repo per run keeps concurrent dev-lead runs in a single repo to one,
# avoiding rebase storms and token exhaustion from a fleet-wide burst. Shared
# across BOTH the primary and legacy-label sweeps so the per-repo budget covers
# every path that could engage dev-lead.
