#!/usr/bin/env bash
# deploy-standard-workflows.sh — Deploy org-standard workflow stubs to all repos.
#
# Reads canonical stubs from standards/workflows/ and deploys them into every
# repo in the petry-projects org by opening a pull request per repo (via the
# shared scripts/lib/standards-deploy.sh primitive). Only workflows that have a
# template in standards/workflows/ AND appear in the DEPLOYABLE_WORKFLOWS list
# below are eligible — tech-stack-specific workflows (ci.yml, sonarcloud.yml)
# must be set up manually.
#
# Deployment is PR-based, never a direct push to the default branch: a direct
# Contents-API push is rejected (HTTP 409) on repos whose ruleset enforces
# required status checks, and bypasses review/CI on the repos where it would
# succeed. Opening a PR works uniformly on protected and unprotected repos and
# leaves an auditable, CI-gated record. The PRs are labeled `standards-sync` and
# left for the normal review/auto-merge pipeline — this script never merges and
# never uses --admin. See petry-projects/.github#478.
#
# Usage:
#   deploy-standard-workflows.sh [options]
#
# Options:
#   --dry-run              Print planned actions without opening any PRs.
#   --workflow <name.yml>  Deploy only this workflow (default: all deployable).
#   --repo <name>          Target a single repo instead of all org repos.
#   --force                Re-deploy even if the file looks correct (re-syncs).
#
# Requirements:
#   GH_TOKEN (or gh auth login) with repo scope (branch + PR creation).
