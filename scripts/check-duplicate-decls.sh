# check-duplicate-decls.sh — required CI gate against the #1485 corruption class,
# ported from petry-projects/.github-private (#1520) into this repo (#1025).
#
# Fails when a load-bearing file declares the same TOP-LEVEL symbol more than
# once. Three detectors, each targeting a duplication that a merge can introduce
# while every existing test stays green (so nothing else catches it):
#
#   shell (*.sh)    duplicate top-level FUNCTION declaration. Bash last-wins
#                   semantics mean a duplicated function silently shadows its
#                   earlier copy, so the suite passes while the file is wrong —
#                   the signature that landed on trunk wholesale in #1292/#1378
#                   (see #1485 for the incident record). Detection is identical
#                   to .github-private's scripts/lib/conflict-integrity.sh.
#   markdown (*.md) duplicate top-level HEADING (H1/H2). A shell-only sweep would
#                   not catch the AGENTS.md duplication in PR #1024 (23 vs 12
#                   top-level headings); standards docs here are equally
#                   load-bearing. Fence-aware, so `#`-comments inside code blocks
#                   are not mistaken for headings, and sub-headings (H3+) that
#                   legitimately repeat across sections are not gated.
#   json (*.json)   duplicate object KEY, or an unparseable file. jq and most
#                   loaders silently keep the last value for a duplicated key, so
#                   a corrupted ruleset/standard parses "fine" while dropping
#                   config; we fail loud instead.
#
# Deliberately narrow (matches #1520's AC):
#   - Tree-state, not diff-aware: standing corruption fails, whoever introduced
#     it. This is the merge-blocking backstop, not an introduction detector.
#   - Functions only for shell. Top-level VARIABLE reassignment at column 0 is
#     legitimate (defaults overwritten conditionally), so var duplicates are not
#     gated — the corruption signature that reached trunk was duplicated bodies.
#   - Top-level headings only for markdown. Repeated H3+ sub-headings (e.g.
#     "### Agentic Directives" under several sections of AGENTS.md) are normal.
#   - No escape hatch by design. If an intentional duplicate is ever genuinely
#     needed, amend this script in a reviewed diff.
#
# Usage: check-duplicate-decls.sh [dir]   (default: the repo root this file lives
#        under). Scans recursively, skipping the excluded dirs below.
